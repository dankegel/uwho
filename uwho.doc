NAME
     _u_w_h_o - look up e-mail addresses by name and organization  or
     country

SYNOPSIS
     uwho [ -_o_p_t_i_o_n_s ] _n_a_m_e [ @ _o_r_g ] [ , _n_a_m_e [ @ _o_r_g ] ] ...

     uwho [ -_o_p_t_i_o_n_s ] -help | -list | -update  whois-server  ph-
     server

DESCRIPTION
     _u_w_h_o lets you look  up  somebody's  e-mail  address  without
     knowing  the  details of where such information is kept.  It
     keeps a list of the many whois, ph and kis  servers  on  the
     Internet,  and when you look up somebody's address, it looks
     it up on all the servers whose organization name matches the
     approximate organization name you specified.

     On the commandline, uwho expects the person's name, followed
     by  '@', followed by the name of the organization where they
     have e-mail.  Spaces are  allowed  anywhere  in  a  name  or
     around '@'.  The person's last name or last and first names,
     and any part or parts of the organization's name  or  domain
     name,  can  be  used  as  search  keys.  To search for, say,
     Smithers at the Massachusetts Institue  of  Technology,  you
     could type

          example% uwho smithers@mit

     or

          example% uwho smithers@massa tech

     If no organization is specified, the default  host  (set  by
     -h) is searched.

     To specify both first and last names,  give  the  last  name
     first,  followed  by a comma, and then the first name.  Note
     that no space is allowed before  this  comma,  and  a  space
     afterwards is optional.  For example,

          example% uwho smithers, john @ mit

     To search by country, use an organization of c=xx, where  xx
     is  the two-letter ISO code for the country.  (Use the -list
     option to see examples of these  codes.)   You  can  combine
     country codes with organization names; for example,

          example% uwho smithers, john @ tech C=US

     You can search  for  several  names  at  the  same  time  by
     separating them with space separated commas " , ".  This can

     be useful if you're unsure of the spelling of a name; e.g.

          example% uwho smithers, john@mit , smythers, john@mit

     If no search string is  given,  and  none  of  the  "-list",
     "-update", or "-help" options are specified, _u_w_h_o will enter
     interactive mode, and prompt the user for the search string.

USER OPTIONS
     -help           Brief information about _u_w_h_o

     -p              Enable output pager if supported  (see  also
                     ENVIRONMENT)

     -t _t_i_m_e_o_u_t      Set the timeout for  network  reads  (0  for
                     none).   Overrides  the  default value of 15
                     seconds.  Use -t 30 or so if servers seem to
                     always truncate their answers.

     -verbose        Print extra info about the progress  of  the
                     query,  such as the exact string sent to the
                     remote server.

     -list           List the directory servers known by _u_w_h_o

ADMINISTRATION OPTIONS
     -literal
          Do not process the outgoing query  in  any  way.   Used
          mainly for debugging.

     -h _h_o_s_t _p_r_o_t
          Set the host and protocol used when no organization  is
          specified  (i.e. this should point to your local direc-
          tory server).  Overrides the default  values  specified
          during compilation.

     -dir _d_i_r_e_c_t_o_r_y
          Set the data directory where _u_w_h_o's  server  lists  are
          stored  Overrides  the  default  value specified during
          compilation.

     -update whois-server ph-server
          Update the server lists with information from the given
          uwho  and  ph  list  servers;  uses the queries 'whois-
          servers' and 'ns-servers', respectively.  Should be run
          roughly monthly.

     -whoisd
          If no query is entered on the commandline, uwho  always
          enters  an interactive mode.  Normally, the interactive
          mode prompts the user to enter queries, and treats each
          line as a command or a query.  If -whoisd is specified,

          the interactive mode does not prompt,  and  only  reads
          one line; also, output lines are terminated with CR LF.

EXAMPLES
     You should begin by searching for person by first  and  last
     name,  and  back  off to last name only if your first search
     does not find the person.  Some hosts do not  understand  it
     when  you  give  first  and last names.  For example, if the
     search

          example% uwho Kegel, Daniel@caltech

     comes up empty, try the search

          example% uwho Kegel@caltech

     Most hosts have a help file that tells you  more  about  how
     you can search for names or report problems, e.g.

          example% uwho help@stanford
     or
          example% uwho '?'@ddn

     Note the quotes around the question mark; you need these  to
     keep  the  shell  from treating the question mark as a wild-
     card.

OUTPUT FORMAT
     _u_w_h_o prints the message

     n queries pending...

     while it sends your query to the selected servers;  it  then
     prints  a  banner  before  showing each server's response to
     your query. The banner indicates the host name of the organ-
     ization being queried and a short description of the organi-
     zation. For instance,

          example% uwho help@stanford

     produces

     Opening 1 socket(s).

                                                      Stanford University
     etc.

DIAGNOSTICS
     If no organizations, or too many organizations,  are  found,
     _u_w_h_o  complains  and  asks  for a more detailed organization
     name.

     If a requested server does not respond withing the time  out
     duration,  _u_w_h_o gives up on it, and a message to that effect
     is printed.

ENVIRONMENT
     If the environment variable UWHO_OPTS exists,  its  contents
     are  treated as if they were typed on the uwho command line.
     e.g. if UWHO_OPTS contained "-dir mydir/etc -t 5",

          example% uwho joe@foo

     would be equivalent to

          example% uwho -dir mydir/etc -t 5 joe@foo

     On systems supporting popen(3S), if the environment variable
     PAGER  exists, it is used as the name of the pager to invoke
     when the -p option is given. The default value is "more".

WHOIS SERVER CAPABILITY
     Although uwho is portable, it is often impractical  to  port
     it  to  all  environments  and  distribute  it to all users.
     Therefore, uwho can itself act as a whois or finger  server.
     Rather  than accessing an internal database, it forwards all
     queries to real whois (or ph, or kis)  servers.   This  lets
     anyone  with  a  whois  or  finger program access uwho.  The
     INSTALL document describes how to do  this;  basically,  you
     have  to  add  a  line to /etc/inetd.conf which invokes uwho
     -whoisd.

C-CALLABLE INTERFACE
     Uwho is written in plain vanilla C, and uses Berkeley  Sock-
     ets  for  its  network  interface.   The search engine is in
     uwho.c, and has a well-defined interface; it would  be  easy
     to  incorporate  uwho's  functionality  into mail clients or
     whois servers.

FILES
     uwho.ws - list of whois servers
     uwho.ph - list of ph servers
     uwho.dat - list of all known servers

     the  Internet",  which  is  available for anonymous FTP from
     many sites.

BUGS
     KIS protocol lookups are implemented to  do  only  MCI  mail
     queries  at  the  moment, although KIS could also be used to
     access X.500 directories.  Also, they are arbitrarily  slow.
     Use -t appropriately.

     Country codes of ph servers are guessed  from  their  domain
     addresses.  A  country code is not given for MCI Mail (isn't
     it transnational?).

ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS
     This package would not exist if it weren't for Matt  Power's
     awesome whois servers list.
