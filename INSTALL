(Install document version: %W% %G%)

To install uwho on an MS-DOS system:
1. Pick the makefile appropriate for your TCP/IP vendor:
   i.e. one of
	makefile.lwp
	makefile.nfs
	makefile.tcp
	makefile.tk4
2. Edit it to reflect where you want the uwho data files to go.
3. Compile uwho using a Make utility, e.g.
	nmake -f makefile.nfs
4. Initialize uwho by typing:
	uwho -update sipb.mit.edu nwu.edu
   You should reinitialize it about every two weeks to keep its tables
   up to date.  See the Unix example below for more details.
5. Test uwho.  Type
	uwho -list 
   If it prints out a list of a hundred or so servers, all is well.

MS-DOS bugs: 
    uwho has hardly been tested on ms-dos at all.  
    The port was provided by Stan Barber, bless his soul, but
    I may have screwed up in merging his changes in to the mail distribution,
    so beware.


To install uwho on a VMS system:

1. Edit vmsdef.h.
1A. Select your TCP/IP vendor by uncommenting one of the lines:
	/* #define MULTINET */
	/* #define WOLLENGONG */
	/* #define UCX */
    Example:
	#define MULTINET

1B. Pick a disk and directory to save uwho's data files in by filling in:
	#define UWHO_DIR ""
    Example:
	#define UWHO_DIR "dua0:[uwho]"

2. compile uwho by executing the .COM file approprite for your TCP/IP vendor,
   e.g. one of the three
	@multinet.com
	@wolleng.com
	@ucx.com

3. Define a symbol in the global symbol table as follows:
	$uwho :== $disk:[directory]uwho -dir [directory]
   where [directory] points to where you've chosen to store uwho's data files
   (same as in step 1B above).

4. Initialize uwho by typing:
	uwho /update sipb.mit.edu nwu.edu
   You should reinitialize it about every two weeks to keep its tables
   up to date.  See the Unix example below for more details.

5. Test uwho.  As a normal user, type
	uwho /list 
   If it prints out a list of a hundred or so servers, all is well.

VMS bugs:
    Options may be started with slashes, but multiple options can't
    be combined in one word as is usual with VMS, i.e.
	uwho /list/p
    fails; you have to type
	uwho /list /p
    instead.
    There is no online help file.
    The current version supports output paging, but it doesn't work quite 
    right yet; it seems to eat chars in interactive mode,
    and add extra blank lines after blank output lines!


To install uwho on a Unix system:

1) Edit Makefile.
1A) Select your computer's architecture by uncommenting the appropriate ARCH
    definition line.  The default is
    ARCH = -DUNIX -DSUNOS
1B) Select a C compiler and options by editing the lines
    CC = gcc
    CFLAGS = -Wall -DANSI $(ARCH)	
1C) Select destination directories for the executable, data, and manual files
    by editing the lines
    BIN = /usr/local/bin
    ETC = /etc/local
    MAN = /usr/local/man
    # Select manual section and extension for the manual files.
    MANSECT = 1
    MANEXT = 1
1D) Specify the default server hostname and protocol by setting DEF_HOST
    to the hostname, and uncommenting one of the DEF_HOST_PROTOCOL lines:
    DEF_HOST = horton
    #DEF_HOST_PROTOCOL = uwho_PROTO_PH
    DEF_HOST_PROTOCOL = uwho_PROTO_WHOIS
1E) Pick an output pager by uncommenting its three macros PAGER, PAGER_OBJ,
    and PAGER_H.
    If you're running this under Unix, POPEN_PAGER is preferred; otherwise, 
    DUMB_PAGER is ok; if that doesn't work, use NO_PAGER.

    e.g. under Unix,

    PAGER = POPEN_PAGER
    PAGER_OBJ = 
    PAGER_H = 

    #PAGER = DUMB_PAGER
    #PAGER_OBJ = pg.o raw.o
    #PAGER_H = pg.h

    #PAGER = NO_PAGER
    #PAGER_OBJ = 
    #PAGER_H =

2) Type 'make'.  Uwho should compile with no errors.
   Become the superuser (or whatever pseudouser will own the uwho data files),
   and type 'make install'.  This installs the executable,
   creates the data directory if needed, downloads initial server lists,
   and installs manual pages.
   Note: if you don't want to run 'make install', you'll have to run
   uwho -update, e.g. 'uwho -update sipb.mit.edu nwu.edu', manually.

3) Select nearby whois and ph servers to periodically download server lists
   from.
   If your local whois or ph server supports the 'whois-servers' 
   or 'ns-servers' queries, respectively, you should use them as your
   list servers.
   Otherwise, get an up to date list of whois list servers with the query
	whois -h sipb.mit.edu whois-list-servers
   and choose the closest host in the list for your master server;
   similarly, choose a close ph server that supports the ph-servers query.
   There is no ns-list-servers query, but as of this writing, the following 
   hosts have an up-to-date ns-servers record:
    ns.vtt.fi, ns.cs.hut.fi, ns.uiuc.edu, whois.uoregon.edu,
    prism.uchicago.edu, ns.bgu.edu, ns.nwu.edu

   Add a line like
	MM HH DD,DD * * /BIN/uwho -update WHOIS_SERVER PH_SERVER >/dev/console 2>&1
	where MM, HH, and DD,DD are when to run uwho -update,
	      /BIN is the value chosen for BIN in Makefile,
	      WHOIS_SERVER is the whois server chosen above, and
	      PH_SERVER is the ph server chosen above,
   to crontab (under SunOS 4.x, use 'crontab -e') to update uwho's database 
   roughly twice monthly.  
   (It's a good idea to at first set the crontab entry to execute
    two minutes from now today, and make sure it works, before
    setting it to run every two weeks.)

4) If your organization has a whois or ns server that can be accessed 
   from outside, but is not already listed by uwho -list, 
   send your organization's name and the hostname of its whois and ns
   servers to mhpower@athena.mit.edu (who maintains a list of whois servers)
   and to j-norstad@nwu.edu (who maintains a list of ns servers).
   These are the lists that are downloaded by uwho -update.

   If you're interested in talking to ph/ns administrators, the mailing 
   list info-ph may be of interest; to subscribe, write 
   to info-ph-request@uxc.cso.uiuc.edu.
   (There is no mailing list for whois administrators that I know of.)

5) If you'd like to use uwho as a meta-whois server, add the line
    whois 	stream 	tcp 	nowait 	nobody 	/BIN/uwho uwho -whoisd
   to /etc/inetd.conf, and restart inetd (or send it a HUP signal, if your
   inetd is polite).
   Be sure that the DEF_HOST and DEF_HOST_PROTOCOL chosen in Makefile do 
   not refer back to this server, or you'll have an infinite loop on your hands!

   This is the easiest way to make uwho available to a large number of people.


TROUBLESHOOTING

If uwho prints
    database file uwho.dat unreadable or non-existent; 
    was this software installed properly?
the first time you run it, it's complaining that you haven't run
'uwho -update whoishost phhost' yet.  This is normally run first when 
you type 'make install', but some people accidentally skip that step of
the above procedure.
