uwho is a simple tool for accessing the many whois servers
on the Internet.  It lets you look for somebody's e-mail address
without knowing the details of where such information is kept.
A large part of its power comes from its ability to download an
up-to-date list of whois and ph servers. 

To search for a person at a given organization, one types
	uwho person@org
This searches all whois servers matching the given organization name, 
for information about the given person.  Partial or abbreviated organization 
names, and/or country names, can also be given, e.g.
	uwho person @ mit c=us
searches for the given person at all organizations in the US with 'mit' in
their name.

All network access is done in parallel, and completes in about ten seconds.

It is intended for use on any Unix, VMS, MS-DOS, or Windows NT system, but 
has only been tested with SunOS 4.1.1, NeXT 2.0, HP/UX, and VMS.
It is written to be very portable; uwho.c can easily be incorporated into 
other programs, e.g. X Window or Mac programs, or even whois servers. 
It isn't yet really polished.

It can also act as a whois or finger server, to allow people without
direct access to the uwho program to nevertheless use its capabilities
by accessing a server running uwho.  Furthermore, its search engine
has a well defined interface, and can be called from within other C programs,
for example, real whois servers.
